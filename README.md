I am a Psychology graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

My journey in computer science at A Level and love for problem solving has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field. I have completed the certification exams for CompTIA A+, Network+ and Security+ and I am currently working on projects to bolster my portfolio.
